1. A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
2. Git repository with your portfolio code

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

### 2. Connect to Vercel

### Serverless Configuration

This project is configured to work with Vercel's serverless functions:

- `server.js` exports the Express app for Vercel and also works locally
