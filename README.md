## üåê Serverless Architecture

This portfolio is designed to work both locally and as a serverless application on Vercel:

- **Local Development**: Run with `node server.js` for a traditional Express server
- **Vercel Deployment**: Automatically runs as serverless functions
- **Database Connection**: Optimized with connection pooling for serverless environments
- **API Routes**: Seamlessly work in both environments

## üìß Contact Form Setup

You have two options for setting up the contact form email functionality:

### Option 1: Gmail App Password (Simpler but less secure)

1. Enable 2FA on your Gmail account:
   - Go to your Google Account > Security
   - Under "Signing in to Google," select 2-Step Verification > Get started
   - Follow the steps to turn on 2-Step Verification

2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to your Google Account > Security
   - Under "Signing in to Google," select App passwords (requires 2-Step Verification)
   - Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Portfolio Contact Form")
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password (spaces will be removed automatically)

3. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

### Option 2: OAuth2 Authentication (More secure, recommended)

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project
4. Create OAuth credentials (Web Application type)
5. Add `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` as an authorized redirect URI
6. Save your Client ID and Client Secret
7. Go to [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)
8. Click the gear icon and check "Use your own OAuth credentials"
9. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
10. Select Gmail API v1 and authorize with scope `https://mail.google.com/`
11. Exchange the authorization code for tokens
12. Add these values to your environment variables:
    ```
    EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
    CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
    ```

### Troubleshooting Email Issues

- Make sure Less Secure App access is turned off

- Verify that all credentials are entered correctly
- Try using a different email service if Gmail continues to cause problems
